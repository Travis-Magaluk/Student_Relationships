# Student_Relationships

## Overview
In the fall of 2021, the Faculty and Staff of Wasatch Academy participated in an exercise to understand how well we know our student body. Faculty and Staff were instructed to place a symbol next to each student's name in the column that you resonated with. Colums included Know Student by Name and Face, Know What Kind of Student this person is, Know Something Personal About this Student, or Have a Personal Connection with This Person. 
After this exercise we looked at the sheets and tried to make sense of the data from a visual standpoint. I approached my supervisor and said that I would like to have the oppurtunity to work with this data, and see what factors may or may not have an effect on how well faculty and staff are able to know our students. I started gathering other data such as behavior reports, hours of community service, lenghth of tenure at Wasatch Academy, as well as other data points to see what stood out to me in the Exploratory Data Analysis Phase. I worked with other collegues to ask questions and to come up with better statistical methods I could employ on this data set. 

The Jupyter Notebook in this repository is the summary of my work on this project leaving out any sensitive student information. 

I was able to create a presentation and share out my findings with the faculty and staff of Wasatch Academy. Slide Deck from this presentation is also included in this repository.
